I created this website to learn [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and discover
the [experimental `/app` directory](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#new-app-directory-beta).
This is also my first time using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
I wanted to create a simple website that I can use to showcase my projects and
amateur radio achievements.

## Setup

Most of the setup was done by following the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
I used the [official TailwindCSS guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)
to setup TailwindCSS.

## Vercel

To deploy this website, I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Setup was easy and
I was able to deploy it with my personal domain.

I also added [Vercel's analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) to see how many
people visit my website and where they come from.

## Content

I used MDX to write the content of this website. To display the content, I
used [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/).

## Inspiration and resources

To create this website, I heavily relied on [Lee Robinson's portfolio](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).
With his source code, I found out about Contentlayer and the [Metadata definition](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/guides/seo).
