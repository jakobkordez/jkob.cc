To show of my Instagram posts I decided to implement a gallery on my website.
I searched for a bit but I couldn't find a good solution.

## The Instagram API

I used the [Instagram Basic Display API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api),
but I was a bit confused on how to get the access token required for making the requests.

I found a package called [instagram-gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/instagram-gallery) that
gives some simple steps on how to get the access token.

### Getting the access token

The package documentation gave these steps:

- Log in to [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/)
- Create an app that uses Instagram basic display
- Add a test user in the roles section
- Accept the tester invitation on Instagram (Settings > Apps and Websites > Tester Invites)
- Go back to the Facebook Developer portal and you should be able to generate a token for the account

## Enviromental variables

To keep the access token and my user id hidden I used enviromental variables.

The `.env` file in the source code is there to show the structure of the file.
To store my secrets localy I used the file `.env.local` which is ignored by git by default.

Because I use Vercel to host my website I had to add the enviromental variables to the Vercel dashboard.

## Fetching and displaying the posts

Displaying the posts was pretty simple. Because Next.js supports server side rendering
I could just use a [Server Component](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#server-components)
which has access to the enviromental variables.

To fetch the posts I used the [Media endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/reference/media#fields).

To avoid sending too many requests I used a [`revalidate`](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/segment-config#revalidate) value of 30 minutes.

## Source code

You can find the commit with the implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakobkordez/jkob.cc/commit/85fd50c5965aad959e604239a6e5710417ebaeec)
