This is my first project using Next.js. This website started as a resource
for students that wished to get into amateur radio and get their license.
It was then expanded to include a quiz to practice for the exam.

The website was designed with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) with the help of
ChatGPT.

## The expansion

The website was expanded to turn into a website for the radio club at my
former high school [Vegova Ljubljana](https://www.vegova.si/). The website
was expanded to include a blog and an image gallery.

The expansion was done by another former student of the school
[Å½iga Kralj](https://www.zigakralj.com/) and I.

The website is now available at [rklub.vegova.si](https://rklub.vegova.si/).

## Source code

The source code is available on a [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.vegova.si/rkv/spletisce).
