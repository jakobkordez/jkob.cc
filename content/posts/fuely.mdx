Fuely is a web app I made for tracking fuel consumption between my family members.
With multiple cars and drivers, it's hard to keep track of who consumed how much fuel and who fueled up the car last.

The app is built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS with Supabase as the backend.
It was my first time using Supabase and I was impressed by how easy it was to set up and use.
